This was the first assignment for the Essential Computing course at Roskilde University.
The assignment consisted of making a physics based simulation on how fish react to sharks. The sharks have a radius, in which fish are repelled. The fish then get attempt to flee from the shark, based on vector calculations.

The movement of the fish are created via a randomly generated waypoint, to which a vector is drawn. Once a fish enters the shark's zone, it will still try to move towards the waypoint while it avoids the shark.

---Controls---
Left click: Spawn a fish at the mouse location.
Right click: Spawn a shark.
R: Remove all the sharks.
D: Debugmode (allows you to see the vectors and shark repel-zone, as well as some data).

---Note---
This assigment was created in Processing.
The report for the assignment has also been uploaded, which explains the solution.
